4. Hamiltonian cycles (Dirac's Theorem), Eulerian circuits\\
5. Connectivity: connected and k-connected graphs, Menger's theorem\\
6. Ramsey theory: edge colourings of graphs, Ramsey's theorem and its variations, asymptotic bounds on Ramsey numbers\\
7. Planar graphs and colourings: statements of Kuratowski's and Four Colour theorems, proof of Five Colour theorem, graphs on other surfaces and Euler chracteristics, chromatic polynomial, edge colourings and Vizing's theorem\\
8. Random graphs: further asymptotic bounds on Ramsey numbers, Zarankiewicz numbers and their bounds, graphs of large firth and high chromatic number, cmplete subgraphs in random graphs.\\
