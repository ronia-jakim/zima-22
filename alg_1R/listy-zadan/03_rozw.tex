    \section*{ZAD 1. $H<G$, $G$ - cyclic $\implies$ $H$ - cyclic}

    We know that
    $$G=\{..., g^-k,...,g^0=3,...,g^k,...\}$$
    Now, because $H<G$, we know that for every $h\in H$, we have $h\in G$ so there exists $k\in\N^+$
    $$h=g^k$$
    and because $H$ is a group, also 
    $$h^{-1}=g^{-k}\in H.$$
    
    Let $m$ be the least positive integer such that
    $$g^m\in H.$$
    We want to show that then $H=<g^m>$. Suppose that $H$ is not generated by $g^m$, meaning that there exists an $h\in H$ such that $h=g^l$ for $l=m+n$, $0<n<m$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        g^l g^{-m}=g^{m+n}g^{-m}=g^mg^ng^{-m}=eg^n=g^n\in H
    \end{align*}
    But then $n$ is smaller than $m$ and we have a contradiction of our supposition.


    \section*{ZAD 2. $H_1,H_2<G$; $H_1\cup H_2<G$ $\iff$ $H_1\subseteq H_2\;\lor\;H_2\subseteq H_1$}

    $\impliedby$
    \smallskip

    Without loss of generality, let us say that $H_1\subseteq H_2$. Then
    $$H_1\cup H_2=H_2$$
    and it is trivial.
    \medskip

    $\implies$
    \smallskip

    We know that $H_1\cup H_2<G$. Let us suppose that neither $H_1$ is a subset of $H_2$ nor $H_2$ is a subset of $H_1$. Then let us take any
    $$h\in H_1\;\land\;h\notin H_2$$
    $$\eta\in H_2\;\land\;\eta\notin H_1.$$
    They are both in $H_1\cup H_2$ so they are elements of a group. Therefore, their product, $h\eta$ should also be contained within this group. But because $h\notin H_1$, we cannot have $h\eta\in H_2$. Similarly, $\eta\notin H_1$ so $h\eta\notin H_1$. So we cannot have $h\eta\in H_1\cup H_2$. So we have a contradiction. Therefore, either $H_1\subseteq H_2$ or $H_2\subseteq H_1$.
